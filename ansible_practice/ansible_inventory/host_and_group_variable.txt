# gotta convert this to a md file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
we can define variale to groups in inventory file like this :

suppose a group in inventory file has common variable ntp and port
with same values.
eg:- 
      [web_servers] #this is how the group is defined
      webserver_1 ntp_server="abc.ntp.org" http_port=443
      webserver_2 ntp_server="abc.ntp.org" http_port=443

then we can just add a variable group with all the common variables
and common value

        [web_servers: vars] #this how to declare variable which are 
                            #common inbetween group
        ntp_server=abc.ntp.org
        http_port=443

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Although we can define group and host variable in default inventory
it is not a good practice and make code difficult to read

In this case we use host and group variable file

host variables are stored in : /etc/ansible/host_vars
    
    here create the file for host that you want to have some different
    keys/values than default

    lets say both webserver_1 and webserver_2 has different port and 
    ntp servers,
    then we can create /etc/ansible/host_vars/webserver_1 and store 
    the value of ntp and port there.
    same can be done for webserver_2

    Note: Host file have the same name as host

group variables are stored in : /etc/ansible/gropus_vars
    
    here create the file for group that have common keys and values

    lets say group webserver have common port and 
    ntp servers,
    then we can create /etc/ansible/group_vars/webserver and store 
    the value of ntp and port there for all nodes of webservers.

    Note: group file have the same name as the group which file is being
          created
